# ElderMUD Design Outline
## A concise document depicting the object and function of the system.
### Core Features Desired
- Party system, up to 4 players per party, up to 4 parties per raid.
- Guild system, with membership and rank assigned by NPC leadership.
- PvE largely, with some PvP areas.
- Character progression is with experience, levels, and skill trees.
- The world has leveled areas, so players may not want to wander into places that are too high-level for them.
- Level progression is set to a competitive but non-grinding balance.
- Skill trees are similar to the Elder Scrolls games.
- Crafting involves collecting ingredients from the world, taking them to a crafting station, and designing what you want.
- Weapons and armor can be improved. I am undecided as to whether they should wear out and require repair.
- There should be lively NPCs having conversations with each other, traveling around the map, attacking people, sharing mead, etc.
- Bands of NPCs can travel together.
- I'd like to have a dynamic, realistic economy. Items can be bought and sold all over the map, bringing all kinds of profits and interesting goods. NPC traders and PC traders are both viable.
- Multiple races to choose from, representing all the various races of the Elder Scrolls.
- Resources can be gathered, harvested, mined, etc. and nothing gets wasted. Everything changes hands and gets distributed around the system.
- Old goods are regularly recycled into new materials and new goods are constantly being traded from craftsmen.
